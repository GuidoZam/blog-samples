# Overview of the Declarative Agent template

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.

## Get started with the template

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Preview Local in Copilot (Edge)` or `Preview Local in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
4. Select your declarative agent from the `Copilot` app.
5. Ask a question to your declarative agent and it should respond based on the instructions provided.

## What's included in the template

| Folder       | Contents                                                                                 |

The following are Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit specific project files. You can [visit a complete guide on Github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-Visual-Studio-Code-v5-Guide#overview) to understand how Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit works.

| File           | Contents                                                                                                                                  |

| `m365agents.yml` | This is the main Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions. |

## Extend the template

- [Add conversation starters](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=3): Conversation starters are hints that are displayed to the user to demonstrate how they can get started using the declarative agent.
- [Add web content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=4) for the ability to search web information.
- [Add OneDrive and SharePoint content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=5) as grounding knowledge for the agent.
- [Add Microsoft Copilot connectors content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=6) to ground agent with enterprise knowledge.
- [Add API plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=7) for agent to interact with REST APIs.

## Evaluating Agents

Install the Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Evaluations CLI (`@microsoft/m365-copilot-eval`) NPM package to test, measure, and improve the quality of your agent with structured evaluations and rich result reports with AI-based scoring.

> Requires [Admin consent](https://github.com/microsoft/work-iq/blob/main/ADMIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md) at tenant level.

1. Run `npm install -g @microsoft/m365-copilot-eval`
2. Add the following environment variables. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/evaluations-cli-get-env-values#get-your-azure-openai-endpoint-and-api-key) on how to get them.

    ```
    AZURE_AI_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_AI_API_KEY=
    AZURE_AI_API_VERSION=
    AZURE_AI_MODEL_NAME=
    ```

3. Provision the project first (select **Provision** in the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit) so the agent is available in your tenant before evaluation. Skip this step if you have already provisioned (or started a local debug session) for this project.
4. Run `runevals` or `runevals --env dev`

A sample dataset `evals/prompts.json` is created in this project to help you get started right away. [Read more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/evaluations-cli-overview).
