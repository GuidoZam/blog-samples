## Features

This sample illustrates how to use the `IDynamicDataCallables` interface to connect two web parts together. The first web part is a provider, and the second web part is a consumer. The provider has no configuration in the property pane, the consumer instead has properties in the property pane that allow the user to select the provider web part and the specific property to bind.

The `IDynamicDataCallables` interface define the methods that the provider web part must implement to expose its properties to the consumer web part.

One of the required methods in the provider web part is the following:
  
```typescript
public getPropertyDefinitions(): ReadonlyArray<IDynamicDataPropertyDefinition> {
  return [
    {
      id: Constants.FirstNamePropertyId,
      title: strings.FirstName,
    },
    {
      id: Constants.LastNamePropertyId,
      title: strings.LastName,
    },
    {
      id: Constants.PreferencesPropertyId,
      title: strings.Preferences,
    },
  ];
}
```
This define the properties that the provider web part exposes to the consumer web part.

The other method that the provider web part must implement is the following:

```typescript
public getPropertyValue(propertyId: string): string | IPreferences {
  switch (propertyId) {
    case Constants.FirstNamePropertyId:
      return this._firstName;
    case Constants.LastNamePropertyId:
      return this._lastName;
    case Constants.PreferencesPropertyId:
      return this._preferences;
  }

  throw new Error(strings.BadPropertyId);
}
```
This method returns the value of the property identified by the `propertyId` parameter.

In the provider web part the properties are updated by the user through the UI, and the consumer web part is automatically updated with the new values, to enable the automatic update the provider web part must call the `notifyPropertyChanged` method every time a property is updated, for example the following code is called every time the first name is updated:

```typescript
private _firstNameChanged = (firstName: string): void => {
  this._firstName = firstName;
  // notify subscribers that the first name has changed
  this.context.dynamicDataSourceManager.notifyPropertyChanged(
    Constants.FirstNamePropertyId
  );
};
```

The consumer web part's properties that needs to be connected to the provider web part must be defined in the property pane using the `PropertyPaneDynamicField` as the following:
  
```typescript
PropertyPaneDynamicField("firstName", {
  label: strings.FirstName,
})
```

In the consumer web part's properties the dynamic properties must be specified as the following:

```typescript
firstName: DynamicProperty<string>;
```

The last step to display the value of the connected property in the consumer web part control is to use the property as the following:

```typescript 
const firstNameValue = this.props.firstName?.tryGetValue();
```
