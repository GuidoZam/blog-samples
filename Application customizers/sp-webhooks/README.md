# Notification Application Customizer with Webhooks

This project demonstrates a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Application Customizer that uses webhooks to display notifications when a SharePoint list changes. It leverages PnPjs, React, and the SPFx List Subscription API.

## Features

- Subscribes to SharePoint list changes using webhooks
- Displays notifications in a custom Toast component at the bottom of the page
- Handles theme changes for better visibility in both light and dark modes
- Fetches and displays the latest item and its editor when a change occurs

## Prerequisites

- [PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/) installed.
- Entra App Registration with appropriate permissions. Can be created using [this guide](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/registerapplication.html).
- Permissions to perform management operation on the SPO site in order to configure the application customizer.

## Configuration

### 1. Deploy the Application Customizer

Deploy the solution package to your SharePoint App Catalog and add the app to your site.

### 2. Configure the Application Customizer Properties

You can configure the Application Customizer properties (such as the `listId`) using PnP PowerShell.
To connect to your SharePoint site use the following command:

```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://<YOUR-TENANT>.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite" -ClientId "<YOUR-ENTRA-APP-REG-ID> -Interactive
```

Once connected, you can add the Application Customizer with the required properties:

```powershell
Add-PnPApplicationCustomizer -Title "Notification Customizer" -ClientSideComponentId "<YOUR-COMPONENT-GUID>" -ClientSideComponentProperties "{`"listId`":`"<YOUR-LIST-GUID>`"}" 
```

> Replace:
>- '<YOUR-TENANT>' with your tenant name.
>- `<YOUR-COMPONENT-GUID>` with the ClientSideComponentId of your Application Customizer (from the manifest).
>- `<YOUR-LIST-GUID>` with the GUID of the SharePoint list to monitor.

## How it Works

1. The Application Customizer subscribes to list changes using the List Subscription API.
2. When a change is detected, it fetches the latest item and the user who modified it.
3. A Toast notification is rendered at the top of the page, styled for visibility in both light and dark themes.
